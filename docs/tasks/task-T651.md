# T651 — Release manager verdict

**ID:** T651
**Owner:** release-manager
**Status:** done
**Priority:** P1
**Tier:** judgment
**Depends on:** T648, T649, T650
**Affects:** —
**Created:** 2026-10-15
**Completed:** 2026-10-15
**Based on:**
- `docs/plans/plan-122-release-v8-wave-3.md` (Task Decomposition item for T651)
- `docs/artifacts/release-v8-audit-v2.md`, `docs/artifacts/release-documents-ruling-v1.md`
- The user's approval of plan-122 on 2026-10-15 (AskUserQuestion, verbatim option label): "Approve as written (Recommended)"; the decisions quoted in the plan's header.

## 1. What and why

After the QA, Tech Lead and Security verdicts exist, complete `## Gate Verdicts` and issue the `## RELEASE VERDICT` block in `docs/releases/v8.0.0.md` (counts per the counting rule of T645; the `Release` line equals the `Status`). Acceptance: `python3 scripts/verify-release-docs.py --tag v8.0.0` and `check-version-consistency.py` pass; one local commit; no tag, no push.

## 2. Output

As stated in section 1.

## 3. Constraints

- Work in your own worktree/branch; one Conventional Commit ending with `Co-Authored-By: Claude Sonnet 5.5 <noreply@anthropic.com>`. Do not push; do not merge; never create, push or delete a tag or a release; never use or print `WIKI_TOKEN`; do not edit `docs/tasks/active-tasks.md`, `completed-tasks.md` or any brief's Status line.
- Never open `tests/golden/held-out/`; never write a held-out case id anywhere; run `python3 -m unittest tests.functional.test_golden_held_out_isolation` on every artifact before it is committed. No `.env*` or credential files; do not read the user's local `.claude/settings*.json` or `.vscode/mcp.json`.
- Mark anything you did not re-read **(unverified)**.

## 4. Acceptance criteria

As stated in section 1.

## 5. Blocker protocol

Report each blocker with its type (`technical` | `dependency` | `unclear_requirements` | `external`) and severity (`critical` | `major` | `minor`).
